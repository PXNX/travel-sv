  make the selection of trains connections look a bit more streanlined and
  nicer.

I apologize, but I cannot find any previous conversation or context about train connections or design in the chat history. Could you provide more details about what specific improvements or streamlining you're looking for in the train connections interface? Without seeing the current design or understanding the specific requirements, I can offer some general suggestions:

1. Clean, minimalist layout
2. Clear typography
3. Color-coded routes
4. Easy-to-read connection times
5. Responsive design for mobile and desktop
6. Simple filtering and sorting options

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these suggestions or provide a more specific design recommendation?
